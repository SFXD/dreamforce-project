# Purpose

This Repo is to give a single point of collaboration for the dreamforce project of the Salesforce Exchange.
If you don't know who we are or what this project is, you can join the Discord server using the badge at the top of this page.

The general idea of the project is to build a mostly-standard training component in Salesforce showcasing capabilities of Summer 18.
More information to come after completion and documentation.

# Contributing

Please read our Contributing Guidelines for contribution.
We all share one Salesforce User because we're using a Developer Edition, which means we don't have much history in Salesforce itself.
This means using Git and Github properly is mandatory so we don't get lost and write over each other.

# Legal Stuff

We do not own Salesforce, the Salesforce Logo, the Aller typeface, the Discord Brand, the Discord Logo, or any other trademark we reference.
The only reason they are referenced is because we are a Salesforce-focused community, and we almost exclusively are based on Discord.
Please direct any copyright claims to the `#general` channel of the discord server.
