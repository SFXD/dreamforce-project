# Contributing to the Dreamforce Project

Thanks for your interest in contributing!
Here are a few guidelines to follow - note that we're all working under one user (yay developer orgs) so if you think this is a bit overkill, it's to compensate that specific point.


## Pushes, Pulls, and general commit flow

Step 1: Create a Branch if you're a collaborator, or a Fork if you are not.
NO ONE pushes to master.

Master should be updated via Squash&Merge Pull requests only.

Your standard participation should be:
- create a branch/fork
- develop feature
- pull from Master to be sure to have no conflicts
- create a Pull Request which squashes all your previous commits
- Code is merged to Master.

## Auto-updates and access

Every commit to a Branch of this repo is reflected in the #github channel of the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/VpUJgEu)

We also have a dedicated category in the Server, `Dreamforce-project`. This category contains only one channel `#dreamforce-project` as of now, but will probably be expended as we move forward to have multiple other disccussions.

The category, as is the channel, is protected to avoid people coming in and griefing.
You can request access via `#meta`.

### Updating the Server

A weekly update must be given on `#general` so people may see advancement and request to join the project.
The update can respect the following format:

__**Dreamforce Project Update**__


__*** Advancement ***__

	Initialized Repo
	Created basic contribution outline
	More Awesome stuff

__*** Help needed ***__

	Need devs for Component estimation

__*** General Status ***__

	On time for the Call for presantations.
